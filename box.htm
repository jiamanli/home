		<p id="paragraph">The box is a rigid enclosure within the front end of the shoe 
		that encases and supports the dancer's toes. The front of the box is 
		flattened to form a platform so the dancer can balance, and fabric
		covers the exterior of the box for aesthetics. In conventional pointe shoes, 
		the box is made from tightly packed layers of paper and fabric that
		have been glued together and then shaped into an enclosure. When the glue 
		dries, it becomes hard and provides the required stiffness. In some newer 
		pointe shoes, the box is made from plastic and rubber, with rigidity 
		provided by the plastic. Box shapes vary widely among shoe models and 
		manufacturers. A number of shape attributes, including box length, height, 
		taper angle and platform area, determine the suitability of a shoe for any 
		particular foot.
