		<h1>About Dance</h1>
		<p id="intro">Dance is a performing art consisting of rhythmic movement, usually to music. It is a way for people to express themselves 
		through movements of their bodies. Stories can be told and emotions displayed through dance. Dance can be categorized and described by its 
		choreography, the repertoire of movements, or its historical period or place of origin. An important distinction is to be drawn between 
		the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance. Other activities often include some form of dance in them, including martial arts, 
		gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and more.</p>
