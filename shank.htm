		<p id="paragraph"/>Shanks are usually made of leather, plastic, cardstock, steel or 
		layers of glue-hardened burlap. The flexibility of shanks is determined
		by the shanks thickness and the type of material used. The thickness may
		be consistent throughout the shoe or it may vary along its length to produce 
		different strengths at select points. For example, slits may be cut 
		across a shank at demi-pointe to enhance the roll through. Also, a shank's 
		thickness may transition at some point along its length in order to 
		implement differing strengths above and below the transition. Standard 
		pointe shoes typically have a full shank, where the shank runs the 
		full length of the sole, or fractional length shanks. Many pointe shoe 
		manufacturers will offer a choice of shank materials, and some will build 
		shoes with customized shanks of different stiffness and lengths.
